# 📘 Spatial Statistics for Data Science — R Code Companion

This repository contains a collection of **R syntax and examples** adapted from the book *"Spatial Statistics for Data Science"* by **Paula Moraga**.
All code has been compiled in **Quarto (.qmd)** and **HTML** formats, so you can easily run, copy, or modify the examples without typing everything from scratch.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is intended to help anyone who wants to:

* Learn **spatial statistics** using **R**
* Understand the practical implementation of spatial methods discussed in Paula Moraga’s book
* Save time by reusing and customizing ready-to-run code examples

## 📚 Reference

Moraga, Paula. *Spatial Statistics for Data Science: Theory and Practice with R*. CRC Press.

## 💡 Notes

* All examples are based on the author’s original materials but rewritten and organized for learning purposes.
